# A Gentlemen's Debt Matrix #

A web app designed to facilitate gentlemanly debt sharing.  When one friend pays for your movie ticket - you should pay him back, not with money, but with a gesture in kind. The problem with this is that it becomes hard to keep track of who owes who in the flow, and eventually someone just decides to 'call it even'.  I think it is much more fun to continue the back and forth of debt.  

This app will allow you create groups of friends with whom you have this sort of relationship.  You will enter actual dollar values, but the app will just present a graphical indication of general debt flow.
